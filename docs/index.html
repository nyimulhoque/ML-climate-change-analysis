        <h3 style="text-align: center;font-family:verdana;">Team Members: Rachel Allgaier, Nyimul Hoque, Emir Ibrisimovic, Arnovi Moinuddin, Elizabeth Perego</h3>
    </br>

    <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Background</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">As the world's population increases and as it moves towards a more booming industrial and technological period, people need to remember to take care of the planet. If no changes are made to reduce the world's aggressive carbon dioxide emissions, we will eventually reach a tipping point at which climate change will be irreversible. Finding out which countries are making significant progress towards full dependence on renewable energy (and other sustainable solutions) and which are making little to no progress can help determine which areas of the world require the most assistance. Our project will focus on showing which countries are moving towards more sustainable solutions and which countries are already implementing those practices successfully (and why). Using this information, we will also highlight the countries and areas that are not using sustainable practices and what they would need to do to implement these practices. Machine learning is useful when modeling human preferences, so we will leverage clustering algorithms and linear regression to uncover patterns of human energy consumption (Rolnick 2019) and predisposition to adopting sustainable solutions which will be discussed further within the methods section.</p>
    
    <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Problem Definition</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">Renewable energy solutions often require more investment and technology to implement, so they may be harder to access depending on the country. We can project future growth and bring up potential ways to boost the change in areas that are developing by shining a light on areas that are already adopting renewable solutions. To better visualize this, we will utilize mapping and analyze background factors and trends. Additionally, we want to analyze the sustainability laws and specifically the attitudes of consumers in these areas to see what variables impact their predisposition to improving sustainability practices (Beiser-McGrath 2019). One way our team has studied sustainability trends thus far is through analysing three data collections that make up what is known as the Trilemma Index for a country. These three data sets are energy equity, environmental sustainability and energy security. These three components come together to make up the backbone for assessing a country's consistent sustainability growth (The World Energy , n.d.). We also want to highlight other, less obvious, factors that may impact sustainability trends within a country by comparing these datasets to the aforementioned Trilemma scores. This way we can bring each country a step closer to understanding what their next steps need to be in order to successfully adopt sustainable solutions.</p>
    
    <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Data Collection</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">Our team has focused on analysing the Trilemma Index data for each of 128 countries. Every country's Trilemma Index, gathered from the World Energy Council, is calculated based on the average between that country's environmental sustainability, energy equity, and energy security scores, given out of 100 (The World Energy , n.d.). We used a Selenium web scraper to grab the 2020 Trilemma indices from the site, and also obtained the percentage increase in score for every year from 2000 to 2020 based on each country's base score (noted as 100% for ease of comparison) in 2000. The data was already clean when we grabbed it from the site.The main manipulation of the data after getting it from the site was done in excel: since the numbers that we obtained from the world energy website were in the form of a percentage based off of 2000's scores, we had to calculate all other years' raw scores based on that percentage and the 2020 scores.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">Additionally, our team has looked at data sets for each country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 2000 to 2018 and religious composition by country for the year 2010. GDP data was collected from The Maddison Project, and our goal in incorporating GDP data is to identify it as a factor that impacts a country's ability to adopt sustainable solutions. Because this is a primary way to assess a country's wealth, it likely correlates to whether or not a country can afford to invest in the necessary infrastructure to kickstart sustainability practices.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">The religion data our team is using only covers one year however it is reasonable to assume that in the last ten years, religious compositions have not seen much change for each country. This data is given in population count by the Pew Research Center and can give us some idea of the cultural mindset of a country's residents. The emphasis that a population places on environmental consciousness is rooted in the moral background of its people and greatly affects a country's motivation to implement sustainable solutions into everyday living. We will use the data to ultimately analyze how cultural trends impact a country's dedication to finding and utilizing sustainable solutions.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">Additionally, Sustainable Governance Indicators (SGI) were collected from the SGI Network to loosely observe the correlation between the presence, ambition, and implementation of environmental policy in a country to that country's commitment to utilizing sustainable solutions.</p>
    
    <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Methods</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">Our team has used simple linear regression to examine each country's progress from year to year using the last 20 years of Trilemma indices. Originally, we averaged the three separate factor scores, Energy Security, Energy Equity, and Energy Sustainability, in order to get the Trilemma Index for each year for each country. We were able to plot a linear regression line for each country's set of three factors and predict what the next 10 years of Trilemma indices would be for each country based on the average of the three regressions. We calculated the R values for each country's regression model to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions using linear regression.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">Once we had an optimal prediction model for each country, we utilized K-means to cluster countries based on similar projections and their index improvements. In graphical terms, we clustered based on 2000 Trilemma scores vs. 2030 predicted Trilemma scores. We chose to use the data from these two years because one represents the beginning of the data we analyzed, and one represents the future outcomes of each country's Trilemma scores based on a regression of all of the data points from 2000 to 2020. We felt that using 2030 predictions would be more indicative of each country's overall trend, because of its dependence on the entire dataset, rather than using one set of data points from one year as the comparison data set, which has the potential to contain outliers and misrepresent a country's behavior.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">By clustering, we were able to observe how other factors may have contributed to the Trilemma indices of the countries. We studied the correlation between the clustered countries and the religious make-up of their populations, the presence of environmental governing policies, and GDP of each country.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">To capture the countries improperly fit by the simple linear regression model, we utilized both decision trees and random forest in attempts to analyze the nonlinearity in the data for some countries. We mainly focused on the few countries that yielded r-squared values below 70%. We took this approach in attempts to recluster the data with more accurate 10 year predictions for those countries. When hypothesizing the outcome of the nonlinear fitting techniques, we predicted that the results still may be insufficient due to the extreme variability and limited number of testing data points for those respective countries. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">We also created a decision tree to evaluate countries based on their rate of improvement from 2000 to 2020. We wanted to categorize countries based on their growth to better identify what factors may be contributing the most to increasing sustainable presence in these countries. This would ultimately show what struggling countries would need to incorporate in order to better facilitate future sustainable growth.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">Lastly, we created another decision tree and then ran a random forest algorithm based on different factors (GDP, religion, trilemma scores, and continent) to try to classify countries into the following three categories: countries that show little to no promise in an increased trilemma score, countries that show a medium amount of promise in an increased trilemma score, and countries that show a lot of promise in an increased trilemma score.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">To easily visualize our religion data, we created a bar chart to show the percentage of each cluster of countries that fell into varying religious categories. This bar chart can be seen below in the results section. One of these categories is unaffiliated so that we can also see an overall percentage that has any religious background, regardless of belief system.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">Environmental governing policies are represented and quantified in this project by SGI data. Most of the SGI data relates to countries with higher Trilemma indices, presumably because these countries are more developed and have more data readily available, whereas developing countries may not have reporting data for their policies or may not have many policies to report. This does, however, present some amount of uncertainty in our SGI results, since only three countries with average indices and none with low indices have data to report. This is one reason why our team decided to analyze the SGI data outside of coding, instead manually observing the numbers to see any correlations to our other datasets.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">We found that countries with sturdier and more ambitious environmental policy (estimated with SGI scores from 1 to 10) tended to be the same countries that had the highest overall Trilemma scores from 2000 to the projected 2030 scores. The average SGI score for this cluster was 6.22. This indicates that these countries have relatively high amounts of environmental policy that take more action to protect and promote the environment. This is likely a primary factor in the consistently high scores that these countries have. These countries started off early and strong in adoption of sustainable solutions compared to the rest of the world and maintained high scores through the decades that our team assessed. This cluster also saw a very high concentration of countries with largely Christian populations; around 68% of the combined population of these countries is Christian. Overall, around 82% of these countries' populations had some religious affiliation. This gives us reason to believe that countries with strong religious backgrounds were some of the first to adopt sustainable solutions and also have high awareness and concern for environmental preservation. Additionally, as seen below, there seems to be a direct correlation between GDP of a country and how sustainable the country is; there is an extremely large gap in GDP between countries clustered into the largest trilemma scores versus countries in any other group. Most of the countries in this cluster are in Europe, with some presence in South America, Asia, Oceania, and North America.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">For the cluster containing countries with middle of the road Trilemma indices, there was a slightly lower religious affiliation, with 20% unaffiliated population.This cluster had a fairly even distribution of varying religious presences, with Hinduism reaching the highest percentage of the combined population at around 27%. This cluster sees more variance in belief systems, which may cause some discontinuity in cultural importances among the populations. From the three available SGI data points, the average SGI score for this cluster was 4.33. This shows that these countries place lesser emphasis on environmental governance, but still have some policies helping them on their way to future improvement. As shown in the below bar graph, the highest percentage of countries from this cluster are in Asia, but also appear on all other continents, excluding Oceania.</p>
        <div id="container">

    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">The cluster containing countries with the lowest Trilemma indices actually has the largest combined religious population, with almost 98% of people identifying with one religious belief or another. Shown in the graph below, around 55% of the population identifies as Muslim, and another 32% identifies as Christian. This does not follow our expectation of correlation between sustainable presence and religious presence, but might be explained with unique cultural tendencies that come along with these religions. From the data we have, however, this trend cannot be explained. None of the countries in this last cluster had data to report for SGI, so we could not analyze them according to their governing policies, but it may be reasonable to conclude that these countries do not have significant policies to report. A large majority of these countries are in Africa, and the rest are in Asia.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">As mentioned in the methods section, we ran a decision tree non-linear regression algorithm to capture the countries which yielded low r-squared values when fitting simple linear regression models.. As hypothesized, the results were insufficient as the data did not follow a sinusoidal pattern, or any similar pattern, in its nonlinear behavior. Overall, we were able to achieve the desired closeness in RMSE values for training and testing datasets, but the r-squared values were not indicative of proper fit and, oftentimes, were negative values. We experimented properly with the tuning parameters and were careful when considering overfitting; however, the findings were disappointing. This prevented us from reclustering the data with the few countries with nonlinear behavior.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">Our following approach of reclassifying the data through decision trees and random forest yielded slightly more promising results than decision trees for regression. To explain further, we ran a decision tree classification algorithm and used the random forest algorithm to try to strengthen our clusters. We were hoping to use either decision trees or random forest to classify the countries with promising strides in their sustainability scores, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, in a different way that would strengthen the results. For both of these algorithms, we used a master data set that contained the following data for each country: GDP, continent, energy security rank, energy equity rank, environmental sustainability rank, and populations by religion. For the decision tree, the decisions ended up leading to classifications that were about 45% consistent with another set of data that simply took the top, middle, and bottom 33 percentiles of the slopes of average trilemma scores of all the countries. As for the random forest, the table of results is shown below. The accuracy of the random forest algorithm was only able to get as high as 44% (40% is shown below). This meant that the decision tree and the random forest algorithms could not consistently classify which countries had the highest, middle, and lowest promising strides in their future sustainability scores. When running each of the algorithms, the parameters and hyperparameters were constantly changed in hopes of increasing accuracy. The reason for this low accuracy is probably because a country's susceptibility to changing their climate change attitudes cannot be determined from their GDP, continent, religion populations, and trilemma scores. While we thought these features would be enough for classifications, it seems that there are many other factors at play.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">Random Forest Results:</p>
    

    <img id="randomforest" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nyimulhoque/ML-climate-change-analysis/master/docs/pics/randomforestresults.png" alt ="Random forest results" style="width:500px;height:200px;display:block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 50%;">
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">An important component of our problem statement was to identify countries with promising strides in their sustainability scores. Our initial clustering method was crucial in identifying what we predict to be the top countries in sustainability development in 2030. In addition to the classification through decision trees and random forests, we clustered through KMeans again by initial 2020 score and historic rate of growth to see how fast countries are progressing. This provided a new insight as we were able to examine each country more objectively, removing the bias of a head start where a country with ample resources might have higher scores in 2020 in the first place.  </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">The results of the two clustering mechanisms can be visualized with the interactive maps below. The maps are color coded so that countries are in their respective clusters that were mentioned above.  You can hover over the map to see which cluster a country is in and click on that cluster to view any country in that cluster. Try to look for similarities between the maps, which we will reveal in the next paragraph.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">The clusters themselves are not extremely similar, but a noticeable observation is that there seems to be a correlation between countries with the highest slopes and countries with a middle trilemma score. You can also see lots of countries on the western hemisphere seem to have the highest trilemma scores, but are mostly in the bottom and middle thirds of the trilemma score slopes.</p>
   
    
    <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">Discussion and Conclusions</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">The data and regressions that we have already plotted and found are important because we have made progress in estimating how countries' sustainability practices will change over the next ten years. This can already be used to show which countries are more likely to improve their sustainability practices, allowing for more research to be done on what factors lead countries to helping climate change, versus the factors that could lead countries to being less sustainable in the future.</p> 
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">Our decision tree analysis of rate of improvement in Trilemma scores highlight countries that are actively improving versus those that are static or are declining in sustainability. This will help to pinpoint what countries are rapidly improving and through further investigation of these countries, factors that may be contributing to this growth in sustainability can be determined and potentially applied to countries that are struggling to keep up. A couple of the countries that stand out as 'models' for current sustainable growth are Cambodia, Nicaragua, Myanmar, Malta, Kenya, Jamaica, and Albania. These countries may not have the highest trilemma scores, but are making significant progress as they have the highest slopes over the past 20 years. On the other hand, a few countries that need help to catch up are Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Brunei, and Norway. These countries actually have a negative overall slope for their trilemma scores.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family:verdana;">This project can be useful outside of the scope of this class because it can allow companies or organizations to expand sustainability measures to communities that are the most likely to adopt and benefit from them. They can also analyze the areas that are not as susceptible to these measures to see what changes can be made, and how the entire consumer attitude can shift to a more sustainable culture. Our objective was to idenitfy countries with the most promising growth rates and predict which countries will rank the highest in their sustainability scores in the upcoming years. Using KMeans Clustering, Decision Trees and Random Forest Classification Algorithms, and Linear Regression, we were able to achieve this desired outcome.</p>
